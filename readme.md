# credit card fraud detection with Data Science


with an ensemble of data can we determine the fraudulent transactions.

for this project we use python [pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sickit-learn]


this project is a way to take a breif look at 3 things :
    + handling imbalanced data
    + the practiacal differences in 3 classifiaction models
    + the implementation of a very basic **Neural Network.**


---

in the main file i have given a descrioption of all the steps i have done and in the end explained the difference in the 3 models i selected for comparaison.
The 3 models i selected were the very famous : 
    + **Decision Tree**,
    + **Random Forest**,
    + **Tree Classifiers**

---

The original data file was larger than the limit Github offers, so i have used a sample file to showcase the data.
